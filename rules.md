# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
10th March 2019

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
3. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
