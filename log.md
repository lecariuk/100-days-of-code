# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 10th March 2019

Spent today getting my Github repository and my blog set up so I can track my progress on the challenge, ready to start tomorrow. [Claire's Coding Blog](http://www.clairescoding.co.uk/)

**Why I'm taking part in this challenge**: To keep me focused and keep my momentum going as my Web Development Apprenticeship comes to an end in July; improve my coding skills; give me accountability.

**My goals**: My goals over the next 100 days:

1. Complete the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp
2. Re-do the JavaScript training courses in Treehouse to refresh my knowledge
3. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification in FreeCodeCamp
4. Work on my personal website, lecari.co.uk, and create a custom theme for it (WordPress)
5. Complete a book download page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and email marketing software API) for my Apprenticeship evidence
