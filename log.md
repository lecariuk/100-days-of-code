# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 10th March 2019

Spent today getting my Github repository and my blog set up so I can track my progress on the challenge, ready to start tomorrow. [Claire's Coding Blog](http://www.clairescoding.co.uk/)

**Why I'm taking part in this challenge**: To keep me focused and keep my momentum going as my Web Development Apprenticeship comes to an end in July; improve my coding skills; give me accountability.

**My goals**: My goals over the next 100 days:

1. Complete the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp
2. Re-do the JavaScript training courses in Treehouse to refresh my knowledge
3. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification in FreeCodeCamp
4. Work on my personal website, lecari.co.uk, and create a custom theme for it (WordPress)
5. Complete a book download page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and email marketing software API) for my Apprenticeship evidence

### Day 1 & 2: 11th and 12th March 2019

**Today's Progess**: I spent today and yesterday continuing on with the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp - going through the Accessibility section.

**Thoughts**: Making websites accessible and promoting equality and fairness are really important to me. A lot of this is familiar to me through the Treehouse courses I have completed previously (such as adding markup for header, footer, main, and article, and adding alt tags) and the training session that we did as part of our Apprenticeship programme with Andrew Macpherson. But I have learnt some new things that I can apply to my work in future.

### Progress: 14th and 15th March

On Thursday 14th March I did not manage to complete my next day in the #100DaysofCode challenge, as it was a classroom day for my Apprenticeship programme. We talked about how to test a website â€“ an important part of the website design process.

On the 15th I was writing up the blog, working on my testing plan for my project, and reading further into testing and tools to use.

### Day 3: 16th March

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Responsive Web Design Challenges and working through the CSS Flexbox Challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Hope to finish the Flexbox Challenges section tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: A lot was refresher of things I learned on Treehouse. 
Previously I have always used em or px to size text. The fourth Responsive Web Design challenge introduced the concept of using viewport units for responsive typography, which was new to me and will be interesting to use in future.

### Day 4: 19th March

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Flexbox Challenges section on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: A lot of this has been a refresher of Treehouse. I don't remember the flex property so that was interesting to play around with (though of course it is possible that it was covered, and I've forgotten!).
