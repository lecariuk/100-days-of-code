# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 10th March 2019

Spent today getting my Github repository and my blog set up so I can track my progress on the challenge, ready to start tomorrow. [Claire's Coding Blog](http://www.clairescoding.co.uk/)

**Why I'm taking part in this challenge**: To keep me focused and keep my momentum going as my Web Development Apprenticeship comes to an end in July; improve my coding skills; give me accountability.

**My goals**: My goals over the next 100 days:

1. Complete the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp
2. Re-do the JavaScript training courses in Treehouse to refresh my knowledge
3. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification in FreeCodeCamp
4. Work on my personal website, lecari.co.uk, and create a custom theme for it (WordPress)
5. Complete a book download page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and email marketing software API) for my Apprenticeship evidence

### Day 1 & 2: 11th and 12th March 2019

**Today's Progess**: I spent today and yesterday continuing on with the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp - going through the Accessibility section.

**Thoughts**: Making websites accessible and promoting equality and fairness are really important to me. A lot of this is familiar to me through the Treehouse courses I have completed previously (such as adding markup for header, footer, main, and article, and adding alt tags) and the training session that we did as part of our Apprenticeship programme with Andrew Macpherson. But I have learnt some new things that I can apply to my work in future.

### Progress: 14th and 15th March

On Thursday 14th March I did not manage to complete my next day in the #100DaysofCode challenge, as it was a classroom day for my Apprenticeship programme. We talked about how to test a website – an important part of the website design process.

On the 15th I was writing up the blog, working on my testing plan for my project, and reading further into testing and tools to use.

### Day 3: 16th March

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Responsive Web Design Challenges and working through the CSS Flexbox Challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Hope to finish the Flexbox Challenges section tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: A lot was refresher of things I learned on Treehouse. 
Previously I have always used em or px to size text. The fourth Responsive Web Design challenge introduced the concept of using viewport units for responsive typography, which was new to me and will be interesting to use in future.

### Day 4: 19th March

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Flexbox Challenges section on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: A lot of this has been a refresher of Treehouse. I don't remember the flex property so that was interesting to play around with (though of course it is possible that it was covered, and I've forgotten!).

### Day 5: 23rd March

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Grid and completed the Build a Tribute Page challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: This is probably the first time I have ever created a page from scratch. I found this quite hard at first and panicked a bit (“I don’t remember anything!”) but I started with entering in the basic HTML of the page content, then added in the div-id‘s that were required for the challenge, then added the styling. I did look up certain elements from previous FreeCodeCamp lessons but overall I was able to do this on my own, just going through each step logically. It has passed all of the required elements for the certification and I am really pleased with how it turned out!

### Day 6: 24th March

**Today's Progress**: Working on the Responsive Web Design Project, Build a Survey Form, on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I worked on this for about three hours today. Currently it has 15 of 17 passes, so I’m almost there. I need to finish the CSS Styling as so far I have only added the background colour and fonts. I noticed that some of the code that FreeCodeCamp use in their example hasn’t been covered in any of the tutorials so far (I went back and double-checked in case I had missed something), so I had to search for solutions in FreeCodeCamp and W3 Schools.

### Day 7: 27th March

**Today's Progress**: Carrying on with the Survey Form project on FreeCodeCamp – and learning about divs.

**Thoughts**: I did a bit more work on this project today – I was getting a bit frustrated at the spacing around the form elements last night, and so asked a friend who is a UX Developer for help. He explained about using div to me, something that I had known about but hadn’t really quite ‘got’. His explanation was really helpful, and adding in extra div elements and seeing the difference they made really made this ‘click’. I feel like this was something I had used and heard about from FreeCodeCamp and Treehouse courses, but didn’t fully understand the purpose of until now.

### Day 8: 28th March

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Survey Form challenge on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: So pleased to have finished this! I did find this quite challenging compared to the landing page (hence why it took longer) – especially getting all of the styling right. 

I think if I ever wanted to do a longer contact form or survey like this again, I’d use a service like SurveyMonkey that is free and already set up to quickly make these sorts of forms, but it is useful to know how to do it from scratch – especially if, for example, a client wanted the form to be embedded on their website and styled in their own branding.

### Day 9: 31st March

**Today's Progress**: Started the Build a Product Landing Page project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I think I have made a good start on the project so far. I am using things I have learned from the previous two projects, the Tribute Page and the Survey Form, to complete it.
I have also had to look up how to show the icons - it threw me a bit because they aren't image files. I have then looked up the tutorial on W3 Schools about using Font Awesome 5 Icons and I am going to try that tomorrow.

### Day 10: 1st April

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Product Landing page project.

**Thoughts**: Little bit of progress on the product landing page, added icons and played with the position: elements. Will do more on this tomorrow as it's still not displaying correctly.

### Day 11 & 12: 5th & 6th April

**Today's Progress**: Continuing  with my Product Landing Page project.

**Thoughts**: I’ve made a few more changes to the code, but nothing major hence no updates recently. My progress has also been hindered a little bit as CodePen has been going down a lot this week due to a DDoS attack – I hope they get it sorted soon.

I updated the top navigation, added styling to the form at the top, and updated the 'features' section so it's central to the page.

I also fixed the grid, as I wasn't happy with how it was displaying, and managed to get the last two items to pass the User Story requirements - I'd mis-read the instructions!

### Day 13: 7th April

**Today's Progress**: More work on the Product Landing Page project.

**Thoughts**: I added some styling to the video, and added the pricing table - happy with how that looks now!
